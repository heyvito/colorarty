**colorarty** is a small library that analyses images and extracts a background, primary, secondary and detail colors, all suitable for reading.

Here's a simple example that converts extracted colors into CSS declarations:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"image"
	"image/color"
	_ "image/jpeg"
	"os"

	"github.com/victorgama/colorarty"
)

func main() {
	reader, _ := os.Open("/Users/victorgama/Downloads/sample.jpeg")
	img, _, _ := image.Decode(reader)
	result := colorarty.Analyse(img)
	fmt.Printf("#background { background: %s }\n", toCSS(*result.BackgroundColor))
	fmt.Printf(".primary { color: %s }\n", toCSS(*result.PrimaryColor))
	fmt.Printf(".secondary { color: %s }\n", toCSS(*result.SecondaryColor))
	fmt.Printf(".detail { color: %s }\n", toCSS(*result.DetailColor))
}

func toCSS(c color.Color) string {
	cr, cg, cb, _ := c.RGBA()
	r := float64(cr)
	g := float64(cg)
	b := float64(cb)
	r /= 0x101
	g /= 0x101
	b /= 0x101
	return fmt.Sprintf("rgba(%.0f, %.0f, %.0f, 1)", r, g, b)
}

```

The generated CSS was used to build this next example:
